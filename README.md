## Yinsh

Yinsh is an abstract strategy board game for two players, created by Kris Burm. It is played on a hexagonal board where players place rings of their color. The objective is to create rows of five rings of the same color, while removing rings from the board to keep track of the score.

I built a digital version from scratch, using:
- JavaScript and the Canvas API for the game interface
- SolidJS for the navigation UI
- Julia for the game server and adversarial AI (which you can see an example of below)
